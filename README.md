# Simple-White-Noise-Program
I like to listen to white noise while doing work and reading, but all the websites/programs I use have too many frills, paywalls and excessive features. I created a barebones program to play white noise and nothing else for myself, but decided to share it with the world. 

Many individuals with forms of ADD or autism use white noise to focus, however websites and programs blasting the user with ads, unnecessary features etc. can disrupt focus.
